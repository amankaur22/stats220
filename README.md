# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Psychology
- I am taking STATS 220 because I enjoy statistics and want to broaden my knowledge on programming
- I am interested in learning about computational tools 

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
